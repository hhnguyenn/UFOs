# UFOs
Create a dynamic website that can filter user's input; utilizing Document Object Model (DOM) programming interface.  A table was created to filter a JavaScript file.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- D3
- Bootstrap

### Recommendation for futher development
- The table can only filter one class at a time.  A further development can be to filter multiple classes.  For example, instead of just filtering "CA," futher "updates" can be to filter "CA" & "OR" so results can show California and Oregon results.
